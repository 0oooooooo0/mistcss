## Benefits

### Improved code

- Generated code reduces the risk of bugs, errors, and implementation inconsistencies among team members.
- Automatic type safety, eliminating the need to manually write TypeScript types and ensuring that all props passed are valid.

### Simple and stateless by design

- Using only CSS ensures that your components are guaranteed to be stateless and simple.
- No more encountering a `Button.tsx` filled with 1000 lines of complex code when you expected something straightforward.
- You can still incorporate state and logic by wrapping your MistCSS component.

### Compared to CSS-in-JS

- Unlike some CSS-in-JS tools, MistCSS doesn't require a code editor extension. It imposes no API limitations and has no learning curve, granting full access to the power of CSS.
- It allows for writing more concise code without toggling between CSS and JS. Styles are scoped similarly to CSS modules and visual behavior colocated, akin to CSS-in-JS.
- You're not limited though, you can use both where it makes sense.

### Performance

- MistCSS operates with zero runtime, adding no overhead to your project.

### Bonus

- As your codebase becomes cleaner, you'll likely feel more relaxed ðŸ˜Œ
